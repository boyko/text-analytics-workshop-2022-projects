# Text analytics 2022: homework projects

You can find the starter code for two similar homework projects in the 
jupyter notebooks `Hate-Speech.ipynb` and `Vaccines.ipynb`. You should form
two teams (of roughly equal size). Each team should develop only one of
the project.

Create a small presentation up to 10 minutes. You can use a jupyter notebook directly instead of creating a presentation
with slides. The presentation should contain the following key topics:

- (Short) description of the problem, description of the target variable
- The model used to vectorize the tweets
- Description of other features extracted from the tweets (e.g. the length of the tweet)
- Description of the preprocessing steps, e.g. stopwords removal, lemmatization/stemming,
- The model chosen to predict the outcome class
- The predictive performance of the model (using test data)

The expected time to develop the classifiers in these problems is about 2 hours.
Please email me when you are ready with the presentations so that we can 
schedule a meeting (online or in person).
